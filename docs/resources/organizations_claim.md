### Nested Schema for `licences`

Required:

- `key` (String) The key of the license

Optional:

- `mode` (String) Either 'renew' or 'addDevices'. 'addDevices' will increase the license limit, while 'renew' will extend the amount of time until expiration. Defaults to 'addDevices'. All licenses must be claimed with the same mode, and at most one renewal can be claimed at a time. This parameter is legacy and does not apply to organizations with per-device licensing enabled.
